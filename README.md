    Analyzed missing values and null percentages.
    Cleaning
    Removed or imputed missing values.
    Standardized column types and formats.
    Exploration & Visualization
    Histograms and pair plots to understand distribution and correlation.
    Box plots to identify outliers.
    Feature Scaling
    StandardScaler applied to normalize numeric features.
    Model Building
    Used Linear Regression to model relationships (e.g., predicting speed or fuel level).
    Evaluation:
        Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score.

**📈 Results**
    Visualized trends in speed, fuel usage, and other performance metrics.

**📌 How to Run**
    Install required libraries:
        pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn openpyxl

**Open the notebook:**
    jupyter notebook "Internship(Task1).ipynb"
          Make sure the Excel file GPS_Tracking_Dataset_Updated_Filled.xlsx is in the same directory.
